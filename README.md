How it works
Our Resume Scanner takes in three inputs: a list of keywords, the job description, and your resume. Here's how it works:

We read in the list of keywords and the job description from text files and clean them up by removing unnecessary spaces and converting everything to lowercase.
We use the Python PyPDF2 library to extract text from your resume, which we then clean up in the same way as the keywords and job description.
We use the difflib library to calculate the similarity ratio between the keywords and the job description, as well as between the keywords and your resume.
We output the similarity ratios to the screen, giving you an idea of how well your resume matches the job description and how likely you are to get an interview.
